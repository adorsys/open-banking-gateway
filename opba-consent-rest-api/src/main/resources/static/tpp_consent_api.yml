    Interface used by the PsuUserAgent to present consent authorization services to the PSU. The consent authorization process is triggered by redirecting the PSU from
    the [TppBankingApi](https://adorsys.github.io/open-banking-gateway/doc/latest/architecture/dictionary#TppBankingApi) (2<sub>a</sub>)
    over the [FinTechApi](https://adorsys.github.io/open-banking-gateway/doc/latest/architecture/dictionary#FinTechApi) (2<sub>b</sub>)
    to the /consent/{auth-id} entry point of this [ConsentAuthorisationApi](https://adorsys.github.io/open-banking-gateway/doc/latest/architecture/dictionary#ConsentAuthorisationApi) (2<sub>c</sub>).
    The decision on whether the authorization process is embedded or redirected is taken by this ConsentAuthorisationApi.
    
    The following picture displays the overall architecture of this open banking consent authorisation api: 
    
    ![High level architecture](/img/open-banking-consent-authorisation-api.png)
    
    
    #### User Agent
    This Api assumes that the PsuUserAgent is a modern browsers that :
    * automatically detects the "302 Found" response code and proceeds with the associated location url,
    * stores httpOnly cookies sent with the redirect under the given domain and path as defined by [RFC 6265](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265).
    
    This Api also assumes any other PsuUserAgent like a native mobile or a desktop application can simulate this same behavior of amodern browser with respect to 30X and Cookies. 
    
    
    #### Redirecting to the ConsentAuthorisationApi (2<sub>a</sub>)
    Any service request of the FinTechUI to the FinTechApi (1<sub>a</sub>) will be forwarded to the TppBankingApi (1<sub>b</sub>).
    This forward might contain a [PsuConsentSession](https://adorsys.github.io/open-banking-gateway/doc/latest/architecture/dictionary#PsuConsentSession)
    that is used to identify the PSU in the world of the TPP.
    
    The TppBankingApi uses the provided PsuConsentSession to retrieve an eventualy suitable consent that will be used to forward the corresponding service request to the OpenBankingApi (1<sub>c</sub>) of the ASPSP.
    If there is no suitable consent, the TPP might still send a consent initiation request to the OpenBankingApi (1<sub>c</sub>). Whether this request is sent or not
    depends on the design of the target OpenBankingApi. Finally, the TppBankingApi will if necessary instruct the FinTechApi (2<sub>a</sub>) to redirect the PsuUgerAgent (2<sub>b</sub>) to the /consent/{auth-id} entry point of 
    the ConsentAuthorisationApi (2<sub>c</sub>).
        
    #### Issolation Authorisation Request Processing
    The auth-id parameter is used to make sure paralell authorization requests are not mixup.
        
    #### SessionCookies and XSRF
    Each authorisation session started will be associated with a proper SessionCookie and a corresponding XSRF-TOKEN.
    * The request that sets a session cookie (E<sub>1</sub>) also add the X-XSRF-TOKEN to the response header.
    * The cookie path is always extended with the corresponding auth-id, so two Authorization processes can not share state. 
    * Each authenticated request sent to the ConsentAuthorisationApi will provide the X-XSRF-TOKEN matching the sent SessionCookie.
    
    #### RedirectCookie and XSRF (R<sub>1</sub>)
    In a redirect approach (Redirecting PSU to the ASPSP), the The retruned AuthorizeResponse object contains information needed
    to present a suitable redirect info page to the PSU. Redirection can either be actively performed by the UIApplication
    or performed as a result of a 30x redirect response to the PsuUserAgent. In both cases, a RedirectCookie will be associated with the 
    PsuUserAgent and a corresponding XSRF-TOKEN named redirectState will be addedto the back redirect url.
        
    #### Final Result of the Authorization Process
    The final result of the authorization process is a PsuCosentSession that is returned by the token endpoint of the TppBankingAPi to
    the FinTechApi (4<sub>c</sub>). This handle will (PsuCosentSession) will be stored by the FinTechApi and added a PSU identifying information to
    each service request associated with this PSU.

        ##### Desiging the BackRedirectURL (R<sub>6</sub>)
        The BackRedirectURL (OkUrl, NokUrl, etc... depending of ASPSP API) is the URL used by the ASPSP to send the PsuUserAgent
        back to the ConsentAuthorisationApi. Event though the structure of this URL might be constrained by the nature of the
        ASPSP OpenBankingApi, the BackRedirectURL must contains atleast :
        * A redirect-id (as a path parameter) used to isolate many redirect processes form each order.
        * A consentAuthState (as a path or query parameter) used to protect the TppConsentSessionCookie as a XSRF parameter.
        * The consentAuthState might if necessary be used to encrypt the attached ConsentAuthSessionCookie.

        ##### Back-Redirecting PSU to the FinTechApi (4<sub>b</sub>)
        Prior to redirecting the PSU back to the FinTechApi, consent information will be stored by the ConsentAuthorisationApi in a RedirectSession as well.
        * The one time resulting redirectCode will be attached as a query parameter to the location URL leading back to the FinTechApi.
        * After verifying the FinTechRedirectSessionCookie (4<sub>b</sub>), the FinTechApi must forward this redirectCode to the token endpoint of the TppBankingAPi (4<sub>c</sub>). 
        * The TppBankingApi will then retrieve the RedirectSession using the redirectCode and proceed forward with the authorization process.

        * The callback link hast the structure /consent/{auth-id}/fromAspsp/{redirectState}/ok where the redirectState is the XSRF parameter used to validate the RedirectCookie.
        * The way the callback url is passed to the ASPSP is dependent on the OpenBankingApi of the ASPSP.
        * The RedirectCookie has an expiration date after which that callback will no longer be accepted.

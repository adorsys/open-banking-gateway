      # samesite SameSite prevents the browser from sending this cookie along with cross-site requests. Possible values for the flag are lax or strict.
      # The strict value will prevent the cookie from being sent by the browser to the target site in all cross-site browsing context, even when following a regular link.
      # The lax value will only send cookies for TOP LEVEL navigation GET requests. This is sufficient for user tracking, but it will prevent many CSRF attacks.

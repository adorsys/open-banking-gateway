            initiate more than one sca from one browser instance. 
            * Note that the path of the RDC is Path=/v1/XYZ/fromConsentOk/.
            * So RDSC are only sent to the server when a callback link
              commes from the ConsentAuthorisationApi
            * Also note that the callback link hast the structure
              /v1/{redirect-id}/fromConsentOk/{redirectSessionState} where the
              redirect-id is a simple random string (XYZ) and redirectSessionState
              the key to read theRedirectSessionCookie.
            * The callback link is not part of the location link. It is passed to
            the ConsentAuthorisationApi through the ConsentSession shared in the
            backend (BankingProtocol).
            * RedirectSessionCookie has an expiration date after which no callback
            will be accepted from the ConsentAuthorisationApi anyway.
